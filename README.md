## Context of the project:


As a Data Developer, Data Scientist, -Data Analysis and Visualization -Data Normalization -Create a model to classify a person with breast cancer or not.

## Definition of breast cancer

Breast cancer results from a disruption of certain cells which multiply and most often form a mass called a tumour. There are different types that do not evolve in the same way. Some are “aggressive” and evolve very quickly, others more slowly. Cancer cells can remain in the breast.

## Performance criteria
-The model must be able to classify the new patient with his data. The error must be minimal!
